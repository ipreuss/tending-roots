## About the Game

Tending Roots is a cozy Match-3 RPG set in a gentle world of growth and transformation. Unlike traditional match-3 games, matching tiles here transforms energy states rather than simply clearing them.

### Core Concepts

- **Energy Tiles:** Five energy states (Ruhend, Nährend, Fließend, Verwurzelt, Wandelnd) that interact and transform
- **No Fail States:** Every scene reaches a conclusion - your choices affect the outcome, but you always see the result
- **Scene-Based Goals:** Each scene has its own goal, like growing carrots or nurturing plants
- **Cozy Gameplay:** No timers, no pressure - take your time with each move
